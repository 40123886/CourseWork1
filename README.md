CourseWork1

To run this web app open Levinux and navigate to /home/tc/CourseWork1/src and
run python index.py

In the browser go to localhost:5000/

While using this prototype it is useful to note that the only artist with
content populated at the moment is Biffy Clyro.

Within this artist there are 2 albums populated Blackened Sky and Puzzle.

Puzzle album has 2 singles pages created Folding Stars and Saturday Superhouse.

the reason I have only created these pages is simply to give an idea of what
the completed application will look and feel.
